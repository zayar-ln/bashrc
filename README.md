# bashrc-standout

This is my personal Bash setup. It is designed for productivity, speed, and clarity.

I created this because I wanted a terminal that feels like mine. One that helps me type less, catch mistakes, see clearly and don`t need to install zsh.

I use a folder called `.bashrc.d` to keep everything clean and modular. Each file handles one thing. My main ".bashrc" simply loads everything from that folder.

Here’s what this setup gives you

- A colorful prompt that shows where you are and who you are
- Automatic typo correction for common commands like `sl`, `grpe`, `cd..`
- Command categories so I can tag and group tools like file, system, network and so on. ( Also have category to edit )
- Timer that tells me how long a command took if it runs slow
- Better history with time stamps and search
- Short and smart aliases for daily tasks

### How to Install

1. Clone or extract this folder into your home directory
2. Run the `install.sh` script
3. Open a new terminal and you’re good to go

You can also edit or remove any script in `.bashrc.d` if you want to customize it

I made this setup for myself, but you are welcome to use it too.  
It is meant to be light, fast, and helpful. No bloated tools. No heavy dependencies. Just Bash.

If you’re a terminal lover who wants more control and less clutter, this setup is for you.
